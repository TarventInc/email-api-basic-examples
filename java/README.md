# Java Example
To get this example running do the following:

1. Replace the `apiKey` variable value with your API key (To generate an API key, go into Account > API Keys)
2. Replace the `accountId` variable value with your account ID (To find this, go into account and it's at the top-right corner)
3. In the variable `tarventTxHeader`, specify the from name and email you'd like to use (make sure the sending domain has been set up in Account > Domains)
4. In the variable `recipientList`, specify who you'd like to receive the email.
6. Run you java program
7. See the magic happen!

NOTE: To use this code the package `com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonProcessingException` must be included in your java program.
